# image_classification_transfer_learning
This project involves using transfer learning to classify images into categories such as cats vs. dogs by leveraging a pre-trained model like VGG16 or ResNet. Transfer learning allows you to adapt a pre-trained model to your specific problem, making the training process faster and often more effective.
